## Problem statement
Difficulty with understanding between people speaking different languages while online conversation

## End Users
People dealing with language barriers and needs to break them

## Goal
Create a software product, that helps people to have online conversation by means of native language without any other language background.

## Project Description
In the modern world, people are often faced with the need to communicate online in other languages. We offer a mobile iOS application that will help break down language barriers between users. Users will be able to speak in their native language and hear the other person speaking in the same language. Our service will translate all the interlocutor’s speech into the required language and preserve the interlocutor’s voice

## Expected results, outputs and outcomes
A mobile iOS app that enables real-time, voice-to-voice translation:
1. Users speak in their native language
2. Speech is converted to text locally on the device
3. Text is sent to cloud for translation
4. Translated text is converted back to speech
